Document text:
${text.substring(0, 8000)}

Extract information in these sections:
- Project_Overview: project identity, partners, ownership structure, location
- Technical_Design: capacity, technology, equipment specifications, configuration
- Grid_Infrastructure: connection details, voltage levels, distances, grid operator
- Site_Details: area, topography, access, geographical context
- Project_Timeline: key milestones with dates and descriptions
- Financial_Structure: ownership percentages, investment, commercial terms
- Regulatory_Compliance: permits, approvals, required studies

IMPORTANT: Each fact must be a complete, self-contained statement that makes sense on its own.

GOOD examples:
- "Marsa Solar Project is a 300 MWp DC solar facility located in AlWusta governorate near Duqm"
- "OQAE holds 51% ownership stake while TotalEnergies holds 49%"
- "ESIA Scoping study completion is scheduled for 7 August 2025"
- "Solar plant will connect via 132kV LILO at Clare Substation with future 400kV line 4km away"

BAD examples (avoid these):
- "7 Aug 2025" (missing context)
- "51%" (what does this percentage represent?)
- "300 MW" (DC or AC? What is this capacity for?)

For each fact, provide:
- section: one of the sections above
- statement: complete contextual sentence
- key: short identifier for reference (e.g., "project_name", "ownership_oqae", "esia_scoping_date")
- value: the core extracted value (for filtering/sorting)
- confidence: 0.0-1.0

Identify:
1. Critical dependencies (what depends on what)
2. Timing constraints (sequencing requirements)
3. Capacity/sizing relationships (how components are sized relative to requirements)
4. Operational relationships (how systems interact)

IMPORTANT: Express each relationship as a complete statement explaining the dependency.

GOOD examples:
- "Solar plant COD must align with LNG facility COD (January 2028) to ensure carbon neutrality commitment is met"
- "Solar plant capacity of 300 MWp is sized to generate 700 GWh annually required by LNG facility"
- "Full ESIA study depends on completion of ESIA Scoping to define assessment scope and obtain preliminary NOC"

For each relationship, provide:
- section: "Dependencies"
- statement: complete relationship explanation
- key: short identifier (e.g., "solar_lng_cod_dependency")
- value: core dependency description
- confidence: 0.0-1.0

Document text:
${text.substring(0, 8000)}

Look for:
1. Explicitly stated risks or concerns
2. Site changes or relocations (indicates previous problems)
3. Schedule pressure or tight timelines
4. Pending critical approvals
5. Technical constraints or limitations
6. Environmental or social challenges

IMPORTANT: Explain each risk clearly with context about why it matters.

GOOD examples:
- "Project site was relocated from Shinas to Duqm due to technical complexities and cost implications, indicating inadequate initial site assessment"
- "Solar COD must match LNG COD (January 2028) creating schedule risk where any solar delay jeopardizes LNG carbon neutrality goals"
- "Full ESIA not expected until 25 December 2025 leaves minimal time for issue mitigation if significant environmental concerns are discovered"

For each risk, provide:
- section: "Risks_And_Issues"
- statement: complete risk description with impact explanation
- key: risk identifier (e.g., "site_relocation_risk", "cod_schedule_risk")
- value: brief risk summary
- confidence: 0.0-1.0

Identify:
1. Design assumptions and their rationale
2. Technology selections with justification
3. Performance estimates and calculation basis
4. Key engineering parameters

IMPORTANT: Provide context for each assumption or parameter.

GOOD examples:
- "Ground coverage ratio set at 35% to optimize land use while maintaining adequate spacing for maintenance access"
- "Bifacial solar modules selected to capture reflected light from ground surface and increase energy yield"
- "Single-axis tracking system chosen to maximize energy production throughout the day while balancing cost and complexity"
- "Specific yield estimated at 2,500 kWh/kWp/year based on local solar resource data and system design assumptions"

For each item, provide:
- section: one of ["Engineering_Assumptions", "Technology_Choices", "Design_Parameters", "Performance_Estimates"]
- statement: complete description with context
- key: parameter identifier (e.g., "gcr_assumption", "module_technology", "specific_yield")
- value: core parameter value
- confidence: 0.0-1.0
